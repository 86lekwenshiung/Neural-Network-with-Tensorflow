        "The main goal of natural language processing (NLP) is to derive information from natural language.\n",

        "* Text (such as that contained in an email, blog post, book, Tweet)\n",
        "* Speech (a conversation you have with a doctor, voice commands you give to a smart speaker)\n",

        "* Language translation applications such as Google Translate\n",
        "* Word Processors such as Microsoft Word and Grammarly that employ NLP to check grammatical accuracy of texts.\n",
        "* Interactive Voice Response (IVR) applications used in call centers to respond to certain usersâ€™ requests.\n",
